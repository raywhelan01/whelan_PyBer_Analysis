###Module 5 Challenge

#### Part 1 Analysis: Creating the PyBer Summary DataFrame

The summary dataframe we created in this challenge shows a breakdown of the ridership, the number of riders, total fares charged, annd the average fare per ride and per driver for each city type. The chart reveals some interesting information about the differences in PyBer usage in areas of differing population density. One striking insight right off the bat is that there are almost 50% more drivers in urban cities than there were rides in the first four months of 2019. Thus, it would seem that while there are many more drivers in urban environments, the percent of those drivers that are actively driving with the app is likely much lower than it is for rural and suburban cities.

Additionally, we see that while the number of rides increases with population density, there is an inverse relationship with the average fare per ride and driver, with rural rides averaging almost 50% higher fares than urban rides and rural drivers earning almost 4 times as much as their urban counterparts. This increased competition among drivers and the lower profitability per ride likely contribute to our previous observation as urban markets seem to be oversaturated with drivers.


####Part 2 Analysis: Creating the Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type

The line chart created reveals some useful information but does not provide the same level of detail the previous figure did. What this line chart does present is a visualization of how much more money PyBer generates in urban environments than in suburban and rural environments. At its peak, the total weekly fare for rural cities only barely crack $500, while suburban cities' peak week is just shy of $1500, and urban cities' peak is $2500 (with fare less variation from this peak than in the other two city types). Interestingly, there does seem to be some correlation between the peaks and troughs of the lines representing each city type. This could perhaps be attributed to times when the app may run promotions to get additional users requesting rides.
